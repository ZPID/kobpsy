				<p><italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, a complex of several phylogenetic species, is the
					causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis. The ability of pathogenic fungi to develop a
					multifaceted response to the wide variety of stressors found in the host environment is
					important for virulence and pathogenesis. Extracellular proteins represent key mediators
					of the host-parasite interaction. To analyze the expression profile of the proteins
					secreted by <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, <italic>Pb</italic>01 mycelia and yeast
					cells, we used a proteomics approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis with
					matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
					(MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS). From three biological replicates, 356 and 388 spots were detected, in
					mycelium and yeast cell secretomes, respectively. In this study, 160 non-redundant
					proteins/isoforms were indentified, including 30 and 24 proteins preferentially secreted
					in mycelia and yeast cells, respectively. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses revealed
					that 65% of the identified proteins/isoforms were secreted primarily via non-conventional
					pathways. We also investigated the influence of protein export inhibition in the
					phagocytosis of <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> by macrophages. The addition of
					Brefeldin A to the culture medium significantly decreased the production of secreted
					proteins by both <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> and internalized yeast cells by
					macrophages. In contrast, the addition of concentrated culture supernatant to the
					co-cultivation significantly increased the number of internalized yeast cells by
					macrophages. Importantly, the proteins detected in the fungal secretome were also
					identified within macrophages. These results indicate that
						<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> extracellular proteins are important for the fungal
					interaction with the host.</p>

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>The <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> genus represents the causative agent of
				paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), one of the most frequent systemic mycoses that affect rural
				populations in Latin America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Restrepo1">[1]</xref>.
				The genus comprises four phylogenetic lineages (S1, PS2, PS3 and <italic>Pb</italic>01-like)
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Matute1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Carrero1">[3]</xref>. The phylogenetic analysis of many
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> isolates has resulted in the differentiation of the
				genus into two species, <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, which represents a complex of
				three phylogenetic groups and <italic>P. lutzii</italic>, which includes the Pb01-like
				isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Teixeira1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Desjardins1">[5]</xref>.</p>
			<p><italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> grows as a yeast form in the host tissue and in culture
				at 36°C, while it grows as mycelium in the saprobic condition and in culture at room
				temperature (18–23°C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Lacaz1"
					>[6]</xref>. As the dimorphism is dependent on temperature, when the mycelia/conidia are
				inhaled into the host lungs, the transition of the mycelia to the pathogenic yeast phase
				occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-SanBlas1">[7]</xref>.</p>
			<p>The ability of the pathogenic fungi to develop a multifaceted response to the wide variety
				of stressors found in the host environment is of extreme importance for the virulence and
				pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Ranganathan1">[8]</xref>. Many of those
				molecules are extracellular factors, which are either secreted or associated with the fungal
				cell wall. The secreted proteins perform important functions, such as the provision of
				nutrients, cell-to-cell communication, and detoxification of the environment and the killing
				of potential competitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nombela1"
					>[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-BoninDebs1">[11]</xref>.</p>
			<p>In eukaryotic cells, the classical secretory pathway of proteins is driven by a canonical
				N-terminal signal peptide. This classical pathway involves the recognition of a signal
				sequence in the proteins to be exported, which results in their translocation across the
				endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and delivery to the Golgi apparatus <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Schatz1">[12]</xref>. Functional proteins lacking
				predicted signal peptides are secreted into the extracellular medium, thereby suggesting the
				existence of unconventional mechanisms of protein secretion in eukaryotes <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nombela1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Chaves1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nickel1"
					>[14]</xref>. A repertoire of hypothetical mechanisms for driving proteins that lack an
				N-terminal secretion signal through the plasma membrane to the outside of the cell has been
				described for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces
					cerevisiae</italic>. These mechanisms include: passive transport, translocation,
				substrate-specific recognition and the affinity of some proteins to secretory vesicles,
				which lead to adhesion or internalization in endosomal sub compartments <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nombela1">[9]</xref>. In this later mechanism, which is
				described as nonconventional export, the formation of the exosomes is required, which
				involves vesicles derived from membrane invagination (endosomes) resulting in the release of
				internal vesicles to the extracellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Keller1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Nosanchuk1">[17]</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that several fungi
				produce extracellular vesicles containing key molecules associated with virulence, stress
				response and vesicular transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Albuquerque1"
					>[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Vallejo1">[20]</xref>. The
				extracellular vesicles produced by <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and
					<italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> are used for the delivery of molecules associated
				with pathogenesis to the extracellular space. This group of molecules includes well-known
				virulence factors, such as enzymes associated with capsule synthesis in <italic>C.
					neoformans</italic>, laccase, acid phosphatase, heat shock proteins and several
				antioxidant proteins, including superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin and catalases. These
				proteins are recognized by the sera of patients with cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis,
				thereby suggesting that these proteins are produced during human infection <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Albuquerque1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Rodrigues1">[19]</xref>. Additionally, the co-incubation of cryptococcal
				extracellular vesicles with murine macrophages results in a dose-dependent stimulation of
				nitric oxide production by phagocytes and an increase in extracellular tumor necrosis factor
				alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factors β
				(TGF-β) levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Oliveira2">[21]</xref>. These
				findings indicate that the extracellular vesicles of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are
				biologically active and can stimulate macrophage function, thereby activating these
				phagocytic cells to enhance their antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these data suggest
				that fungal secretory vesicles possess the potential to influence the interaction between
					<italic>C. neoformans</italic> and the host cell.</p>
			<p>Our group had described extracellular proteins in <italic>Paracoccidiodes.</italic>
				Proteins lacking predicted signal peptides, such as enolase, have been shown to be secreted
				by <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> into the extracellular medium <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Nogueira1">[22]</xref>. Additionally, formamidase activity has been
				detected in <italic>Paracoccidiodes</italic> cell-free extracts <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Borges1">[23]</xref>. An aspartyl protease has been reported in
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> culture supernatants <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Tacco1">[24]</xref>, and a serine protease, which depicted increased
				levels of transcript during nitrogen starvation, has also been identified in
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> culture supernatants, thereby indicating the potential
				function of this protein in fungus nitrogen acquisition <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Parente1">[25]</xref>. The <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> serine
				protease transcript is induced in yeast cells infecting murine macrophages <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Parente1">[25]</xref> and during the incubation of yeast
				cells with human plasma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Bailo1">[26]</xref>, thereby
				suggesting that the protein plays a putative role in <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>
				interaction with the host cell.</p>
			<p>In a recent study, it has been shown that extracellular vesicles in
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells, <italic>Pb</italic>18, carry antigenic
				molecules (α-galactopyranosyl epitopes) that are recognized by the sera of PCM
				patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Vallejo1">[20]</xref>. The vesicle and
				vesicle-free fractions were used to identify the extracellular proteome via LC/MS <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Vallejo2">[27]</xref>. Eighty-five proteins were
				identified exclusively in the vesicle fractions compared with 140 proteins that were
				detected solely in the vesicle-free fractions, for which 120 sequences displayed overlap in
				both fractions. The authors described 75 extracellular proteins that were common to
					<italic>Paracoccidiodes, Pb</italic>18, and at least two of the other analyzed fungal
				species.</p>
			<p>In the current study, we identified the most abundant constituents of the extracellular
				proteome in mycelia and <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, <italic>Pb</italic>01, yeast
				cells. We also identified proteins differentially secreted by mycelia and yeast cells and
				investigated the influence of protein export inhibition on the phagocytic ability of
				macrophages in an attempt to further understand the role that extracellular proteins play in
				the establishment and pathogenesis of the PCM.</p>

					50°C, and the absorbance was measured at 625 nm. The amount of ammonia released
					for each sample was determined using a standard curve. One unit (U) of FMD activity was
					defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol formamide per mg
					total protein per minute (µmol/mg/min). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
					and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were measured using commercially available
					kits (Superoxide dismutase Assay Kit and Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) Assay Kit,

					highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1), which produces a water-soluble formazan
					(WST-1 formazan) dye upon reduction with a superoxide anion. The reaction product (WST-1
					formazan) absorbs at 440 nm, and it is proportional to the amount of superoxide anion. The
					levels of SOD activity, which were defined as inhibition rate %, were quantified by
					measuring the decrease in the color development at 440 nm. The GST Assay Kit employs
					1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to produce GS-DNB by conjugation of the thiol group of
					glutathione (GSH). The reaction product (GS-DNB) absorbs at 340 nm, and the rate of
					increase in the absorption is directly proportional to the GST activity of the sample. The
					GST-specific activity is defined as µmol of GS-DNB per mg of total protein per

				<title>Extracellular proteins upregulated in <italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01
					mycelia</title>
				<p>A comparative analysis was performed between the extracellular protein profiles of
					mycelia and yeast cells. Based on protein categorization, 30 proteins were preferentially
					secreted by mycelia compared with yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig"
						rid="pone-0052470-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table"
						rid="pone-0052470-t002">Table 2</xref>). The proteins identified are implicated in a
					variety of biological processes, such as cell rescue, cell defense, cell virulence,
					metabolism, energy, cell cycle, DNA processing, protein fate and protein synthesis (<xref
						ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052470-t002">Table 2</xref>). Proteins that play a role in
					cell rescue, defense and virulence include the heat shock protein SSC1, disulfide
					isomerase, glutathione reductase, peroxisomal catalase, thioredoxin reductase and the TCTP
					family of proteins. Enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids were abundant in the
					mycelia secretome. Some of the proteins expressed in the mycelia secretome were
					significantly upregulated compared with the yeast cells, including the
					Cofilin/tropomyosin-type actin-binding family of proteins (fold change of 1911.74),
					peroxisomal catalase (fold change of 61.29), glutamate carboxypeptidase (fold change of
					51.03), aconitase (fold change of 56.98) and heat shock protein SSC1 (fold change of
					35.47) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052470-t002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly,
					several proteins were detected exclusively in the mycelia secretome, including
					detoxification proteins such as thioredoxin reductase and disulfide-isomerase tigA,
					proteins that play a role in the metabolism of amino acids, and proteins involved in
					energy production. The proteins expressed exclusively in the secretome of mycelia
					(compared with the yeast phase) are summarized in Table S2.</p>

				<title>Extracellular proteins upregulated in <italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01 yeast
					cells</title>
				<p>When comparing the secretome of mycelia and yeast cells, 24 proteins were identified that
					are preferentially secreted by yeast cells into the extracellular environment as depicted
					in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052470-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig"
						rid="pone-0052470-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The differentially expressed proteins
					displayed fold changes ranging from 2.72 to 70672.37 when compared with mycelia. Most of
					these proteins play a role in cell rescue, cell defense, cell virulence, cell cycle, DNA
					processing, and energy production (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0052470-t003">Table
						3</xref>). The proteins that play a role in cell rescue, defense and virulence,
					including heat shock protein 60 (fold change of 6.20), Hsp90 binding co-chaperone (fold
					change of 20.97), disulfide isomerase Pdi1 (fold change of 5.76), superoxide dismutase
					(fold change of 2.72), thioredoxin-like protein (fold change of 8.40) and hsp70-like
					protein (fold change of 7.91), were more abundant in the yeast secretome. The
					2-methylcitrate synthase protein was significantly expressed in the yeast phase secretome
					with a fold change of 70672. Interestingly, several proteins were detected exclusively in
					the yeast phase, including glutathione S-transferase, energy production-associated enzymes
					such as pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate mutase, proteins that play a role in cell
					cycle and DNA processing, and proteins involved in cellular transport such as the
					vesicular-fusion protein, SEC17. The proteins expressed exclusively in the yeast secretome
					(compared with the mycelia) are summarized in Table S2.</p>

				<title>Protein isoforms and post-translational modifications</title>
				<p>The 160 proteins/isoforms identified in the secretome of <italic>Paracoccidioides
						Pb</italic>01 are encoded by 86 different genes. Protein isoforms were identified for 37
					of these gene products as depicted in Table S1. This observation suggests that many
					secreted proteins undergo post-translational modification. Table S3 presents the predicted
					post-translational modifications for the proteins identified in the mycelia and yeast
					secretomes. Hsp-70 like protein, heat shock SSC1, and 2-methylcitrate synthase represent
					the molecules displaying the highest number of identified isoforms (seven, eight and nine,
					respectively). The presence of the same protein displaying differential relative migration
					with 2D analysis may be associated with post-translational modification (PTM). To predict
					the putative PTMs, which explain the high isoform frequency, the most common S-T
					phosphorylation and lysine acetylation was included as a variable modification in the
					MASCOT search. The predicted PTMs were confirmed via manual spectral analysis as
					previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Rezende1">[33]</xref>. In
					spite of the limitations associated with the MASCOT search for the PTM study, this
					strategy has been used previously to perform such analysis in organisms <xref
						ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Teutschbein1">[42]</xref>. We observed an increase in
					peptide matches and sequence coverage when using those search criteria. Table S3 presents
					the predicted post-translational modifications for proteins in the mycelia and yeast
					secretomes. A total of 116 isoforms were analyzed using such criteria, and peptides
					displaying phosphorylation, acetylation or both PTMs were detected for 44 isoforms (Table
					S3). Serine/threonine phosphorylation was observed for 31 isoforms, while acetylation was
					observed for 30 isoforms (Table S4). The spectral analysis of isoform 46 of the heat shock
					protein, SSC1, revealed twelve phosphorylation and six acetylation sites. Many isoforms
					identified in the secretome displayed similar molecular weights and different
						<italic>pI</italic>s shifts. In contrast, a series of isoforms differed in both
					molecular weight and <italic>pI</italic>. This observation may be due to other PTMs, such

				secreted by <italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01 yeast and mycelia. This group includes
				proteins that are involved in cellular processes such stress response, metabolism, energy

			<p>We analyzed the <italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01 yeast cells and mycelia secretomes
				and performed a comparative analysis of the changes in protein profiles between the two

				protein/isoforms (Table S1) were detected in <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> mycelia and

			<p>Additionally, proteins that play a role in cell defense, such as peroxisomal catalase,

				(TCTP), were identified in the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> mycelia secretome. The
				increased secretion of enzymes involved in cell defense may reflect a need for increased

				forming protein-protein interactions and modulating the protein function in eukaryotic cells
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Yang1">[54]</xref>. Moreover, 14-3-3 protein
				modulates vesicular trafficking and exocytosis, as displayed in different experimental

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Vallejo2">[27]</xref>. Proteins that function in
				cell rescue, defense and virulence were more abundant in the yeast secretome, which included
				proteins involved in stress response and detoxification, such as heat shock proteins,
				disulfide isomerase Pdi1, glutathione S-transferase Gst3 and superoxide dismutase. During
				the infection process by the pathogenic yeast, the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
				by the immune effector cells plays an important role in killing microbes <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Imlay1">[57]</xref>. Therefore, the response to stress
				is likely to be an important virulence attribute of this pathogenic fungus.</p>
			<p>Proteomics studies can be heavily influenced by the growth conditions. As example,
					<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> was shown to secrete a wide array of enzymes and there
				are significant changes in the relative abundance and composition of secreted enzymes in a
				substrate dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Shah1">[58]</xref>. We
				have used a carbohydrate-and peptide rich medium in our studies that could explain the
				abundance of some glycolysis and TCA-cycle proteins in the secretomes of yeast and mycelia.
				Although this consideration, the yeast and mycelia phase grown in the same medium secrete
				differentially a wide array of proteins/enzymes, suggesting that those molecules are likely
				tailored to benefit the saprobe and pathogenic yeast phase.</p>
			<p>Despite its limitations, 2D gel electrophoresis remains a powerful method for global
				inspection of post-translational modification, as it is associated with shifts in protein
				molecular mass and charge. Among the secreted proteins identified in
					<italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01 mycelia and yeast cells, 37 appeared in more than
				one spot on the 2D-gel, thereby totaling 116 identified isoforms (72.5% of the total). We
				speculated that some of the <italic>pI</italic> or molecular mass changes were caused by
				PTM. Spectral analysis combined with a PTM MASCOT search revealed that 39% of the detected
				isoforms harbor serine/tyrosine phosphorylation and/or lysine acetylation sites. Eight of
				the nine isoforms of 2-methylcitate synthase were found to be phosphorylated, which
				correlates with the decrease in <italic>pI</italic>. We also identified 30 acetylated
				proteins out of 116 isoforms, and all isoforms of the hsp70-like proteins harbored at least
				five acetylated peptides. The <italic>pI</italic> shifts in those molecules correlates with
				those observed in proteins derived from breast cancer cell lines, in which the
					<italic>pI</italic> shifts were consistent with the number and type of modifications <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Zhu1">[59]</xref>. The PTM may be associated with novel
				functions of intracellular proteins located outside of the fungal cells. However, the impact
				of these modifications on pathogenesis, environmental adaptation, nutrient uptake and
				morphological maintenance/changes has not yet been clarified and would require a more
				comprehensive global PTM analysis and more detailed investigation of the impact of each
				modification on the function of each protein modification <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Teutschbein1">[42]</xref>.</p>
			<p>We investigated the function of conventional protein secretion in the
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> macrophage interaction. The addition of BFA to the
				culture medium led to a decrease in secreted proteins, significantly inhibited the
				macrophage/fungus interaction (assessed by the adherence and internalization of yeast cells)
				and caused a reduction in viable cell recovery from macrophages. Consequently, it may be
				hypothesized that the inhibition of macrophage functions might facilitate the survival of
				the pathogen within the phagocytic cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-FlaviaPopi1"
					>[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Konno1">[60]</xref>. The
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells is known to both be phagocytosed by and
				multiply inside macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Almeida1">[61]</xref>.
				The involvement secreted proteins in the uptake of <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> by
				macrophages has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Almeida1"
				>[61]</xref>. The gp43, the main antigenic molecule secreted by
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, participates during the initial steps of attachment of
				the fungus to macrophages was demonstrated when polyclonal antibodies directed to some gp43
				epitopes induced a marked decrease in the phagocytic indexes of macrophages challenged with
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Almeida1">[61]</xref>. These data attest the function of gp43
				extracellular proteins in the adherence of the fungus and uptake by macrophages. Similarly,
				we observed that the addition of BFA significantly inhibited the yeast cells internalization
				by macrophages. In contrast, the addition of concentrated culture supernatant significantly
				increased the interaction of macrophages with yeast cells, thereby suggesting that the
				secreted proteins released by <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells exert some
				biological activity. A similar ability has been described for
				<italic>Leishmania-</italic>secreted vesicles during infection, which deliver effectors that
				mediate parasite invasion favoring survival in the host <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Silverman1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Silverman2">[63]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>Leishmania</italic>
				exosomes and exosomal proteins have been detected in the cytoplasmic compartment of infected
				macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Silverman3">[64]</xref>.</p>
			<p>Specialized secretion systems are used by human pathogens to export virulence factors into

					>[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Kaur1">[66]</xref>. In this
				report, we present evidence that <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> also releases effector
				proteins in macrophages; however, this mechanism remains elusive. We identified 18 secreted
				proteins in infected macrophages, including the protein orthologues heat shock protein 10,
				heat shock protein 70, DNA damage checkpoint protein (14-3-3 protein) and elongation factor
				1 alpha (EF-1α), which have been previously described as exosomal proteins released
				into infected macrophages by <italic>Leishmania</italic>
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Silverman2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Silverman3">[64]</xref>, thereby suggesting that these proteins may be
				effectors present in the host cytosol after the infection by macrophages has been
				established. Moreover, it has been described that the <italic>Leishmania</italic> protein,
				EF-1α, accesses the host cell cytosol and activates multiple host protein-tyrosine
				phosphatases (PTPs), which negatively regulate interferon-γ (INF-γ)
				signaling, thereby preventing effective expression of the macrophage microbicidal arsenal
				including TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) production. Additionally, heat-shock results
				in an increase in exosomal vesicles release into the host cell by
					<italic>Leishmania</italic>
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Hassani1">[67]</xref>. Taken together, these results
				suggest that <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> extracellular proteins may be important for
				fungal survival within macrophages. Therefore, we hypothesized that proteins secreted by
					<italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> may facilitate the survival of the fungus within the
				host, at least during the initial phase of infection, thereby reinforcing the concept that
				secreted proteins released by pathogenic fungi play a crucial role in pathogenesis and
				virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-BoninDebs1">[11]</xref>, <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Tjalsma1">[68]</xref>. We hypothesized that the

				as has been described for other intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Leishmania</italic>

			<p>We found that <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> secrete various types of proteins,
				including enzymes, heat shock proteins and many conventional cytosolic factors. Although we
				cannot completely rule out cellular lyses, the secretome samples were assessed to ensure
				that cell lyses did not influence the extracellular protein profiles. Some of the proteins
				here described have been detected in the extracellular environment in many fungi by
				different groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nombela1">[9]</xref>, <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Holbrook1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Rodrigues1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Vallejo2">[27]</xref>, thereby supporting the suggestion that they are
				indeed exported from intact cells. Interestingly, cytosolic enzymes, such as enolase and
				glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), exert both enzymatic activity and
				alternative extracellular functions in <italic>Paracoccidioides.</italic> These enzymes have
				been found in the cytoplasm and at the cell wall of the <italic>Paracoccicioides</italic>
				yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nogueira1">[22]</xref>, <xref
					ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Barbosa1">[74]</xref>. The cell wall-associated GAPDH
				binds to extracellular matrix components and mediates the attachment and internalization of
				the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells to host tissues, thereby potentially
				playing a role in the establishment of disease <xref ref-type="bibr"
					rid="pone.0052470-Barbosa1">[74]</xref>. <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> recruits
				plasminogen and activates the plasminogen fribrinolytic system in a process mediated by the
				cell wall-localized enolase, which potentially plays a role in the establishment of PCM
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Nogueira1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, cytosolic
				enzymes may represent ‘moonlighting’ proteins functioning in the
				extracellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Chaves1">[13]</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Jeffery1">[75]</xref>.</p>
			<p>Additionally, it is important to note that 63 of the 110 identified proteins/isoforms in
				the <italic>Pb</italic>01 yeast secretome displayed orthologues in the <italic>Pb</italic>18
				secretome. The difference in the number of genes between <italic>Pb</italic>01 and
					<italic>Pb</italic>18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Desjardins1">[5]</xref> may
				explain the variations in the protein profiles. This may also be because they were
				sub-cultured using different media (Fava-Netto for <italic>Pb</italic>01 and modified YPD
				medium for <italic>Pb</italic>18). Additionally, the application of varying proteomic
				methodologies to analyze the extracellular proteins of <italic>Pb</italic>01 and
					<italic>Pb</italic>18 may give rise to the variations found in the secretomes between the
				two members of the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> genus. The fact that members of the
				phylogenetic groups of <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> produce varying combinations of
				extracellular yeast phase proteins is not unexpected; the pools of extracellular proteins
				secreted by different <italic>Histoplasma</italic> strains are also distinct from one
				another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052470-Holbrook2">[76]</xref>. In conclusion, the

			<title>Conclusion</title>
			<p>We have identified abundant proteins expressed in <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast
				and mycelia secretomes. Several extracellular proteins have also been described in the
				secretome of other organisms using different methodologies, which is important for the
				validation of our findings. Strikingly, many proteins do not use the classical secretory
				pathways, and many proteins most likely exert other activity once secreted. Moreover, the
				data clearly indicate that <italic>Paracoccidioides Pb</italic>01 predominantly uses
				non-classical targeting mechanisms to direct protein export. Our findings display the
				potential role that extracellular proteins play in fungus survival in the host and may lead
				to the description of molecules that function as virulence factors.</p>

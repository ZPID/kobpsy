The Excel-Folder in this directory contains the results from several runs of the BioPortal Recommender Tool: 
The unigrams and bigrams from the word lists we compiled to represent typical content from the PsychOpen corpus provide the data for the Recommender tool(you can find the word lists at: TODO).
For each word list, for each of the four recommender selection criteria, a separate run of the tool was executed, where one criterion was assigned the weight 1.0 while the other three criteria were ignored by assigning them the value of 0.0.
